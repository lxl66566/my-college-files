The Damage of E-waste
With the wide use of electric equipment, we are deeply infected by them. The higher efficiency of our mobile phone, the more e-waste we make. That's a severe question around us.
E-waste are harmful to nature. It has a few heavy metals which are toxic, will pollute the earth and water underground, do harm to our health. It's plastic PCB will never be degraded until thousands of years. And it can cause the greenhouse effect for some chemical material released to the air. So it's a vital problem to deal with.
The disposal of e-waste is not a easy question. If we need to mitigate it's contamination, we will pay more money to do that. So it's important to find out a balance point between disposal and cost. There is an efficient way: recycle them. We can extract copper and gold inside of e-waste and reuse them, mitigate contamination by the way. We can also invoke to build a recycle system, to collect and recycle them more easily and efficiently. As college students, we can give speeches to propagate the harm of e-waste and make others aware of it, and pay attention to it.
