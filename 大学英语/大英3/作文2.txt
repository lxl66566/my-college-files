Develop Our Creative Mind
	China is a country which has the most population in the world. That population made it impossible to educate students fairly and creatively. Chinese kids were told to pass the final examination called NCEE, or “Gaokao”, like our life were bet on it. 
	This form of our education which decide one’s life in an exam represents that we could just be educated passively. Students have a specific goal, as well as teachers. They have no motivation to participate in many valuable events, which could be useful in person’s life. We solved problems by established ways, recite poems and solutions, but had no time to put out ideas or made them come true. Those students with vitality and curiosity were mostly pressed down in their early childhood.
	So I hope every teacher, every parent could keep curiosity and creativity of children. Don’t use points to evaluation every people. Give more chances to dig our idea out, encourage us to release our creativity. And, for ourself, try not to blame to this education system, just to put our time to somewhere more valuable. Try to raise questions to this world, be creative to our life.
